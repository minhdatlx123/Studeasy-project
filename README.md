## 🚀 Roadmap

   ### Phase 1: Frontend Foundations (Current Priority)
   - [ ] Integrate React Router
   - [ ] Create main pages (Home, Courses, Course Detail, Login)
   - [ ] Render course list from mock data
   - [ ] Add basic search/filter UI

   ### Phase 2: Frontend Features
   - [ ] Build login/register UI flow (frontend only)
   - [ ] Form validation and error states
   - [ ] Add local state management for user interactions
   - [ ] Improve accessibility and responsive polish

   ### Phase 3: Backend Integration (Later)
   - [ ] Connect to real API
   - [ ] Authentication (JWT/session)
   - [ ] Database integration
   - [ ] Payment flow (future scope)

## 📚 **Key React & TypeScript Concepts Used**

- **Components**: Reusable UI blocks with single responsibility (CourseCard, Header, etc.)
- **Props**: Passing data from parent components to child components
- **State (useState)**: Managing component state (e.g., mobile menu open/close)
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Type-safe prop definitions for components
- **Destructuring**: Extracting props efficiently in function parameters
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying content based on conditions (e.g., isOpen && <Menu />)
- **Component Composition**: Nesting and combining components to build UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design

   ## 🎯 Project Goals

   - [x] Build responsive UI mockup
   - [x] Create reusable component structure
   - [ ] Add page routing
   - [ ] Build course listing and detail pages
   - [ ] Implement frontend auth flow (mock)
   - [ ] Prepare project portfolio for internship/junior frontend roles

## 🔗 **Key Learning Points**

This project is designed as a learning platform for React + TypeScript fundamentals:

- Understanding component hierarchy and props flow
- Working with React Hooks (useState, useEffect coming next)
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Responsive web design with Tailwind CSS
- Building reusable and scalable components
